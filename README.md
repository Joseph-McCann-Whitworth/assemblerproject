 Design: The design of the project is that there will be variables that will store the players stats with health, attack, and name. There will be functions that will be called for the text to appear to the screen depending on where they are in the game. Also, the enemy stats that the player is fighting will need to be stored. Both will need to be able to interact with each other to do be able to do damage and hopefully one of them will die. There will also need to be functions to perhaps randomize the enemy’s health and attack to make the game interesting. I will also need to be able to use functions like write string and random range to help with some of the stuff I will need to do. I will be using the registers as those are needed for the functions random range and write string. I will use structs to hold the player and enemy’s information.
